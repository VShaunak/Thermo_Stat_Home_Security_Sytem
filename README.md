# Thermo_Stat_Home_Security_Sytem
This Arduino build project replicates the ThermoStat and adds a home security together, creating a dual with a backend. Technologies used for the project are Arduino software, embedded C, python and MySQL.


Sensors and Components code name and full name:-
1)Arduino Mega 2560
2)Arduino Uno
3)LDR(Light Dependant Resistor)
4)Servo Motor
5)MQ2(Gas Sensor)
6)DHT-11(Temperature and Humidity)
7)Ultra-Sonic(Distance Sensor and calculator)
8)Vibration
9)BT-Module(Bluetooth module)
10)Mini battery-operated Starter-Motor
11)Buzzer(2)
NOTE: Create a table in your MySQL database as per inside the Python code and then run as per the below-given note.
NOTE: This is a wireless system(not connected to a laptop) as it is replicating real home security, so do not forget to connect the Bluetooth module to the computer system and make sure you select the correct port number while running the serial prompt. After running serial promt then run the python file.
