# Thermo_Stat_Home_Security_Sytem
This is a Arduino build project which replicates the ThermoStat and adding a home security together creating a dual with a backend. Technologies used for the project are Arduino software, embedded C, python and MySQL.


Sensors and Components code name and full-name :-
1)Arduino Mega 2560
2)Arduino Uno
3)LDR(Light Dependant Resistor)
4)Servo Motor
5)MQ2(Gas Sensor)
6)DHT-11(Temperature and Humidity)
7)Ultra-Sonic(Distance Sensor and calculator)
8)Vibration
9)BT-Module(Bluetooth module)
10)Mini battery operated Starter-Motor
11)Buzzer(2)
NOTE:Create a table in your MySQL database as per inside the python code and then run as per the below given note.
NOTE:This is a wireless system(not connected with laptop) as it is replicating a real home security, so donot forget to connect bluetooth module with the computer system and make sure you select correct port number while running the serial prompt. After running serial promt then run the python file.
